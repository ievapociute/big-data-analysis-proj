## Project 1: Image Tranformations
Transforms 8000 images to black-and-white, blur, noise using parallel computing.
Includes two files:
* Image Transformation with Time: saves each transformation together
* Image Transformation with Time v2: saves each transformation separately (not as efficient, adds + 40sec)
